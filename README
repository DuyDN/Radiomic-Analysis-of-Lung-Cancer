Hi!

By the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 I've been helping a friend to make the analysis of her final bachelor project. 

The aim of her project was to replicate the methodology developed by Chaddad et al 2017 and see if the results were consistent.

In words of the author and collaborators: "The study investigates the prediction of Non-Small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient survival outcomes based on radiomic texture and shape features automatically extracted from tumor image data".

Although I cannot share the data used, I can say that for doing the analysis you would need 
- data of patients: survival time, histology, overall stage, clinical t stage, clinical n stage, 	Age.
- data of the gross tumor volume (GTV) from imaging data: Angular Second Moment,	Correlation,	Inverse Difference Moment,	Sum average,	Sum variance,	Entropy,	Difference Variance,	Information Correlation1,	Information Correlation2,	Dissimilarity,	Cluster Shade,	Cluster Prominence,	Coarseness,	Texture Strength,	Small Zone Size Emphasis,	Large Zone/High Gray Emphasis,	Gray-Level/Non-Uniformity,	Zone Size Non-Uniformity,	Zone Size Percentage,	Major Axis Length,	Eccentricity,	Volume,	Fractal Diffraction,	Surface Area


I hope that the code I'm sharing could be useful for someone who wants to realiaze any of the analysis or graphics. 

Analysis folder contains the code for doing:
-Spearman correlation and heatmaps.
-Kaplan-Meir estimation, Long-rank test, and graphics.
-Random Forest:  model and evaluation.
