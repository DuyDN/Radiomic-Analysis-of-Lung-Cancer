Hi!

Between the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, I've been helping a friend to make the analysis of her final bachelor project. 

The aim of her project was to replicate the methodology developed by Chaddad et al 2017 and see if the results were consistent.

The aim of the study is to "investigate the prediction of Non-Small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient survival outcomes based on radiomic texture and shape features automatically extracted from tumor image data".

Although, I cannot share the data I used, I hope that the code I'm sharing could be useful for someone who wants to realiaze some of the analysis or graphics.

The following folders contain the code for doing:
-Spearman correlation and heatmaps.
-Kaplan-Meir estimation, Long-rank test, and graphics.
-Random Forest and its evaluation.
